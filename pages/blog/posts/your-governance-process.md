This was supposed to be a better way, a third way, a web3. You've made overly complex processes because that's what you're used to; that's all you know. What you've designed cannot be codified. You've stripped the autonomy from your organization, all for the glorification of your massive ego.

Nance aims to be a light unto the organizations. We are not perfect, but we strive to establish codified, automated processes so members know the rules and organizations can focus on their main objectives. Great [work happens](https://nav.al/work-hard) in concentrated inspired spurts. When new or old members are compelled to contribute, there should be a clear, automated path to implement their idea before momentum fades.

We started codifying governance processes in 2022 with our first user and primary backer, [JuiceboxDAO](https://docs.juicebox.money/dao). Since then we've automated the processing of over 300 proposals for them.

More recently we worked with MoonDAO (the folks that raised $8M and sent [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXXlSG-du7c) people [to space](https://www.space.com/blue-origin-eiman-jahangir-suborbital-flight-moondao)) to build [a custom interface](https://moondao.com/vote) and [actions palette](https://moondao.com/propose) that suits their organizational needs.

Nance is ready to bring clarity and codification to more. Please [reach out](https://cal.com/edsammy/30min?user=edsammy) so we can make your governance less bad today.
